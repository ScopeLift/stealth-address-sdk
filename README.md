# Stealth Address SDK

This TypeScript SDK provides tools for working with Ethereum stealth addresses as defined in [EIP-5564](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5564). It aims to offer a comprehensive suite of functionalities for both generating stealth addresses and interacting with stealth transactions.

The current version only allows for stealth address generation, which is a work in progress.

## Features

- Generate Ethereum stealth addresses.
- (Planned) Compute stealth address private keys.
- (Planned) Check stealth address announcements.
- (Planned) More features to fully support ERC-5564 interactions.

```bash
npm install stealth-address-sdk
# or
yarn add stealth-address-sdk
# or
bun add stealth-address-sdk
```
